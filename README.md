# OpenWeatherOrg - Real-Time Weather Forecasting with LLM

This project harnesses the power of OpenWeatherMap's weather data and the ingenuity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver real-time weather forecasts in a user-friendly and informative way. It goes beyond basic data presentation by incorporating LLM capabilities to provide:

* **Enhanced Weather Insights:** LLMs can analyze vast amounts of weather data to identify patterns and trends, leading to more comprehensive forecasts.
* **Natural Language Generation:** LLMs can generate human-like descriptions of weather conditions, making forecasts easier to understand and interpret.
* **Interactive Forecasting (Future Potential):** LLMs have the potential to create an interactive experience where users can ask questions about the weather and receive tailored responses.

**Prerequisites**

* Python 3.x
* OpenWeatherMap API Key (https://openweathermap.org/api)
* Library for accessing OpenWeatherMap API (e.g., `requests`)
* LLM Library (specific library choice depends on your chosen LLM provider)

**Installation**
